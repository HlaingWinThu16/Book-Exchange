The Book Exchange System allows users to browse, reserve, and release books. Users can search for books by title and view their status. Developers can modify the system by updating the Book, User, and Catalog classes. To run the system, clone the repository, install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, and run python app.py. For testing, run pytest test-book-exchange.py.
